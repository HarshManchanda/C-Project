# C-Project
THIS C++ SOFTWARE IS ABOUT FLIGHT RESERVATION SYSTEM.
THE PROGRAM CAN BOOK A DOMESTIC / INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT TICKET AND MAINTAIN THE RECORDS OF THE TICKETS RESERVED.
THE PROGRAM CAN ALSO CHECK STATUS OF THE SPECIFIED TICKET AND ALSO CANCELS IT, IF NEEDED.
MOREOVER, A PERSON CAN ALSO ACT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR (IF HE / SHE HAS THE ADMIN PASSWORD i.e "1234") AND CAN VIEW THE UNCONFIRMED RECORDS, UNRESERVED SEATS, IN TABULAR FORM.
THIS SOFTWARE IS ALSO CAPABLE IN SERVING THE CUSTOMERS AS THEY CAN BOOK A TICKET THEMSELVES SINCE RESERVATION NUMBER IS CALCULATED WITHIN THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND THE USER NEED NOT ENTER IT.
